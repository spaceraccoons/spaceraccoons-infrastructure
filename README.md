# Space Raccoons Cloud Infrastructure

This repository contains the necessary files to re-create most of the infrastructure
being used to develop and run Space Raccoons.

We utilize [Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/cloud) by [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/)
to perform fully automated updates to all infrastructure components whenever anything is being
pushed onto the `main` branch of this repository.
